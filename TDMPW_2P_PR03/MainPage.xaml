The land is dying. Vicious storms and an unstoppable blight ravage the scattered remnants of humanity while fearsome new machines prowl their borders, and life on Earth is hurtling toward another extinction.

Along the way, she must reunite with old friends, forge alliances with warring new factions and unravel the legacy of the ancient past."

She is a Nora Brave and machine hunter who is later discovered to be the exact genectic clone of the 21st centery scientist Dr. Elisabet Sobeck. Throughout most of her life she is often mistreated by others, due to her status as an outcast. This results in her forming strong relationship with Rost, despite being her adoptive father."
